texto = 'I remembered the definition that José Dias had given them, eyes of an oblique and disguised gypsy. I didnt know what oblique was, but disguised I did, and I wanted to see if they could call it that. Capitu allowed herself to be stared at and examined. I only asked myself what it was; if I had never seen them. I found nothing extraordinary; the color and sweetness were my acquaintances. The delay of contemplation, I think, gave her another idea of my intention; she imagined that it was a pretext to look at them more closely, with my long, steady eyes fixed on them. And, to this, I attribute that they began to grow larger and darker, with such an expression that gives me an exact and poetic comparison to say what those eyes of Capitu were. I cant think of an image capable of saying, without breaking the dignity of the style, what they were and what they did to me. Hangover eyes? Come on, hangover. Its what gives me the idea of that new face. They brought some mysterious and energetic fluid, a force that dragged them inwards, like the wave that leaves the beach on hangover days. In order not to be dragged away, I clung to the other neighboring parts, to the ears, to the arms, to the hair spread over the shoulders; but as quickly as I sought the pupils, the wave that came out of them was growing, hollow and dark, threatening to envelop me, pull me in and swallow me. How many minutes did we spend on that game? Only the clocks of Heaven will have marked this infinite and brief time. Eternity has its pendulums; not even because it never ends, he never ceases to know how long the happiness and torments will last. It will double the joy of the blessed of Heaven if they know the sum of torments that their enemies will have already suffered in hell. Also, the number of delights his enemies will have enjoyed in Heaven will increase the pains of the damned in hell. This other torment escaped the divine Dante, but Im not here to amend poets. Im about to tell you that, at the end of an unmarked time, I grabbed Capitus hair definitively, but then with my hands, and told her — to say something — that I was capable of combing them if I wanted to.'
